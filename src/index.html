            Freshly painted and centrally located between Salt Lake and Provo, this row-end townhome is full of natural light with plenty of windows in a safe neighborhood.
            </p>

            <p>
            Three stories split the 2,000 square feet of space with three bedrooms, including the large, well-lit primary bedroom on the corner of the home, one bedroom/office on another corner, and the last bedroom with one shared wall. A kitchen on the main floor has exceptional granite counter space, a pantry, and stainless steel appliances. A two-car garage with space for a small workshop or storage area, patio space, and a balcony round out the property. The solar panels on the roof save about $10-$40 per month in electricity.
            </p>

            <p>
            7 minutes from Frontrunner. 25 minutes from downtown SLC, 30 minutes from downtown Provo. 12 minutes from Lehi tech companies.
            </p>

            <p>
            This home is family-managed. There are no monthly fees in addition to rent, and nearly all utilities are included. We are renters too.
            </p>

            <p>
            Note: Square footage, internet speeds, and solar panel generation are estimates
